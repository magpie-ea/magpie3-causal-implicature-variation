# magpie3-causal-implicature-variation
Variations on experiments, building on work by [Gershman & Ulman](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0286067),  investigating PACE effects (*Preferences in Assignment of Cause and Effect*) found in non-causal expressions like "A is associated with B".

#### Exp 3 
- test items
  - "Drug A is associated with B"
  - "A is associated with drug B"
  - "Disease A is associated with B"
  - "A is associated with disease B"
- 400 participants from Prolific
- same as for Exp 2

#### Exp 4 
- test items:
  1. observation condition ("I was surprised to see A in the samples")
    - "A is associated with B"
    - "B is associated with A"
  2. avoidance condition ("I was surprised that you removed A from the samples")
    - "A is associated with B"
    - "B is associated with A"
- 400 participants from Prolific
- same as for Exp 2

#### Exp 5
- similar to Exp3, but different kind of topic-hood manipuation
- test items:
  - "What can you tell me about A?" - "A is associated with B"
  - "What can you tell me about A?" - "B is associated with A"
- 200 participants from Prolific
- same as for Exp 2 

#### Exp 6
- test items:
  - "Having A is associated with B"
  - "Getting A is associated with B"
  - "A is associated with having B"
  - "A is associated with getting B"
- 400 participants from Prolific
- same as for Exp 2 

#### Exp 7
- test items:
  - "A is associated with B"
- preceded by two trial of generating alternative descriptions for "A causes B" with A or B in subject position
